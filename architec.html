<li >  The Taj Mahal incorporates and expands on design traditions of Persian and earlier Mughal architecture.</ li >
<li > The tomb is the central focus of the entire complex of the Taj Mahal. It is a large, white marble structure standing on a square plinth and consists of a symmetrical building with an iwan topped by a large dome and finial. Like </ li >
<li > The base structure is a large multi-chambered cube with chamfered corners forming an unequal eight-sided structure that is approximately 55 metres on each of the four long sides. </ li >
<li > The most spectacular feature is the marble dome that surmounts the tomb. The dome is nearly 35 metres  high which is close in measurement to the length of the base, and accentuated by the cylindrical "drum" it sits on, which is approximately 7 metres high.  </ li >
<li > The main finial was originally made of gold but was replaced by a copy made of gilded bronze in the early 19th century.  </ li >
<li >  The minarets, which are each more than 40 metres (130 ft) tall, display the designer's penchant for symmetry. </ li >
<li > The exterior decorations of the Taj Mahal are among the finest in Mughal architecture. As the surface area changes, the decorations are refined proportionally. </ li >
<li >  The interior chamber of the Taj Mahal reaches far beyond traditional decorative elements. The inlay work is not pietra dura, but a lapidary of precious and semiprecious gemstones.[</ li >
<li >  Muslim tradition forbids elaborate decoration of graves. Hence, the bodies of Mumtaz and Shah Jahan were put in a relatively plain crypt beneath the inner chamber with their faces turned right, towards Mecca. </ li >
