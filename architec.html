<li >  The Taj Mahal incorporates and expands on design traditions of Persian and earlier Mughal architecture.</ li ></br>
<li > The tomb is the central focus of the entire complex of the Taj Mahal. It is a large, white marble structure standing on a square plinth and consists of a symmetrical building with an iwan topped by a large dome and finial. </ li ></br>
<li > The base structure is a large multi-chambered cube with chamfered corners forming an unequal eight-sided structure that is approximately 55 metres on each of the four long sides. </ li ></br>
<li > The main finial was originally made of gold but was replaced by a copy made of gilded bronze in the early 19th century.  </ li ></br>
<li >  The minarets, which are each more than 40 metres (130 ft) tall, display the designer's penchant for symmetry. </ li ></br>
<li > The exterior decorations of the Taj Mahal are among the finest in Mughal architecture. As the surface area changes, the decorations are refined proportionally. </ li >>/br>
<li >  Muslim tradition forbids elaborate decoration of graves. Hence, the bodies of Mumtaz and Shah Jahan were put in a relatively plain crypt beneath the inner chamber with their faces turned right, towards Mecca. </ li ></br>
